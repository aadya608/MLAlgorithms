# Supervised Learning Algorithms

Supervised learning algorithms are machine learning algorithms that learn from labeled data to make predictions or decisions about new, unseen data. 
In this repository, we explore some of the most commonly used supervised learning algorithms, along with code examples and explanations of how they work.
